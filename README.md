If the current date is beyond 2035-01-01 (to be postponed frequently as long as I am alive),
and if this homepage-gen3 is not replaced by a new version of personal website
(which may or may not be named homepage-gen4),
and if I have not been updating my website (this repository) for 700 days,
permission is granted to everyone to host verbatim mirrors of the website
using the latest snapshot zip/tar archive.
Or if you can confirm that I have been dead for at least 1500 days
(one critical evidence being 2000 days of consecutive inactivity),
you are free to host a mirror, too.
